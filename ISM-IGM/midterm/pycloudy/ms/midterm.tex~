\title{ISM/IGM Midterm: Parts I and III}
\author{Andrew Emerick}


\begin{document}
\maketitle
Below are parts I and III. I refer a lot to equations from the handouts and 
Draine without retyping them here. If this is annoying, let me know and I can 
write them out and resubmit. I did part II by hand before starting this latex
file, so that is separate.

\section{1 Ionization and Heating of the IGM}
\subsection{A}
In general, detailed balance gives for both HI and HeII that,
\begin{equation} n_e n_p \alpha_i (T) = n_i \Gamma \end{equation}
where $\alpha$(T) is the temperature dependent recombination rate, $\Gamma$ is
the provided photo-ionization rate per particle, and i is either HI or HeII.
At lower redshift, when the ionized fraction is large, the n$_p$ can be taken
as the total number of bound and free protons. Thus, this equation reduces
to
\begin{equation} x_{i} \Gamma_{i} = n_{e} \alpha_{i}(T), \end{equation}
as given in LF 4.20. Under the assumption that free electrons only come from
ionized Hydrogen, the number density of electrons comes from
\begin{equation} n_e = (1 - x_{HI}) f_H n_o (1+z)^3, \label{eq:ne} \end{equation}
where x$_{HI}$ is the neutral fraction of Hydrogen,
f$_H$ = 0.93 is the fraction of Hydrogen in the Universe by number 
(f$_{He}$ is then 0.07), and n$_o$ is the number density of baryons given
by WMAP as n$_o$=2.542$\times$10$^{-7}$ cm$^{-3}$. This is of course wrong,
as electrons can come from ionizing HeI and HeII, but since He is 0.07 of the 
baryons, the error in this approximation is not large (but is significant). 
Also, accounting for He electrons would make Eq.~\eqref{eq:fraction} a coupled
system between H and He; this would be ugly to solve.
In addition, I assume that the HeI fraction is fixed at zero. 
Differing in notation from 16.56-16.58 in MvdBW, I arrive at the final
expressions for the fraction of HI and HeII in the universe:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:fraction}
x_{HI} &= &(1 + A_{i})^{-1} \\
x_{HeII}& = &(1 + 1/A_{i})^{-1}\\
A_{i}& =& \frac{n_e \alpha_{i}(T)}{\Gamma_{i}}
\end{eqnarray}
where n$_e$ is given in Eq.~\ref{eq:ne}. Although the recombination rate 
coefficient is a function of temperature, I assume T is constant at the 
provided 2$\times$10$^{4}$ K. I take the coefficients using Case A from Draine's
Eq. 14.5. 

The results of this calculation are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fraction},
with the HI and HeII fractions shown in the solid and dashed lines respectively,
the 1\% line is drawn in blue, and the redshifts marking HI reionization 
and HeII reionization are shown in red dotted lines. HI is reionized at 
a z=6.01 and HeII at z=4.08.

marking HI and HeII re-ionization are shown, and are defined as the point
when the fractions dip below 1\%.}
\label{fig:fraction}
\end{figure}

\subsection{B and C.}
The total heating rate per volume is given by equation 16.69 and 16.70 in
MvdBW. Here we are just concerned with HI and HeII. The heating rate is then
dependent upon the results from part A (as it depends upon the number density
of the respective ions), so the assumptions made there extend here. Eq. 16.70 
is long and I will not reproduce it here. I take J($\nu$) is taken as given
in the problem, $\sigma_i$($\nu$) is the photionization cross section for the 
given ion, and is taken in full from Draine Eq. 13.1 and 13.2, and $\nu_i$ is 
the ionization frequency for the given ion. I integrate Eq. 16.70 of MvdBW numerically
using SciPy's integrate.quad function, using the result to calculate the 
heating rate per volume. The actual number density of each ion is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
n_{HI} &=& f_H x_{HI} n(z)\\
n_{HeII} &=& (1-f_H) x_{HeII} n(z).
\end{eqnarray}
The fractions x$_{i}$ are given by Eq.~\ref{eq:fraction} and n(z) is the given
expansion evolution equation. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:heating} gives the results of the calculation. As shown, HeII
heating is always below HI. It becomes more significant, however, soon after
HI is re-ionized. 


at z$\sim$5.56, which is after but near the time that Hydrogen is reionized. This,
intuitively, makes sense. HeII heating continues to dominate over HI until z=0.

\end{figure}

\subsection{D.}
At low redshifts, the thermal evolution of the IGM is going to be dominated by
adiabatic cooling. The effects of cosmological exansion are still present,
but heating/cooling due to the local density fluctuations will dominate. The 
temperature evolution will go as Eq. 4.25 in Chapter 4 of LF,
\begin{equation}
T \approx T_{o}(1+\delta)^{\gamma-1},
\end{equation}

where 1+$\delta$ reflects the local density ($\rho$/$\bar{\rho}$), $\gamma$ is
1.6 at low redshift, and T$_{o}$ is a normalization constant. Other processes
become relevant at higher gas densities, but this equation well approximates
the general IGM temperature.

\subsection{E.}
Collisional processes (e.g. electrons colliding with hydrogen atoms)
are able to heat and ionize a gas, and could conceivably be relevant for the 
IGM. However, the observed Ly$\alpha$ absorption by neutral gas in the IGM
(the Ly$\alpha$ forest) indicates that this is not relevant. Ly$\alpha$ absorption
features in the forest can be used as an indication of the thermal state of the
IGM at a given redshift (the line width is affected in part by Doppler broadening,
a thermal effect). Eq. 16.39 of MvdBW (kind of long, not going to type here)
gives the equillibrium number density of neutral hydrogen in the IGM between ionization
from collisional processes (electrons) and recombination.
As discussed in MvdBW, in order to match with observations of 
the neutral HI via the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the temperature of the IGM must be
above 10$^{6}$ K, which is inconsistent with observations. A typical doppler
broadening value of the IGM in the forest is b$\sim$ 30 km/s. Assuming only 
thermal contributions to b (i.e. ignoring turbulence, so 
$b = \sqrt{2~k_{B}T/m_{H}}$), this implies
an uppler limit on the typical IGM temperature as 5$\times$10$^{4}$ K.

\subsection{F.}
The evolution of the brightness temperature of the 21-cm line is given in LF
Chapter 12 as Eq. 12.8 (again, its long so I'm not going to retype it here).
The a simulation of the evolution is plotted in Fig. 12.9 in the same chapter,
and shows the effect of heating and photoionization on T$_{b}$. The brightness
temperature is at a minimum at around z$\sim$20. Since T$_{b}$ is negative here,
this implies the 21-cm signal can be seen in absorption. As discussed in LF, at 
this point the IGM begins to be heated significantly by the ionizing
X-ray background formed by Population III stars, supernova remnants,
stellar mass black holes, and quasars. After the significant X-ray heating,
T$_{b}$ reaches a maximum around z$\sim$15 and 21-cm can be seen in emission. 
The effect of ionization on the IGM causes another turnaround shortly after
this peak. After reionization begins, the brightness temperature begins to
drop again, causing it to approach zero after reionization (by z$\sim$8). In 
general, this was only a likely sketch of the actual evolution of T$_{b}$, which
depends strongly on the models used. 


\section{3 Ionization and Diagnostics of Photoionized Regions}
\subsection{a) Str\"omgren spheres}
Using Table 15.1 and equation 15.3, I calculated the HII ionization regions
and the Str\"omgren radii for 5 O stars. For the radius of the HII regions
obtained from cloudy, I used the condition given in the problem, where
the ionization region is defined at R(x$_{HI} > $ 0.01). The results are 
tabulated in Table ~\ref{table:stromgren}.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c}
\label{table:stromgren}
Star & Teff & qH & R$_{HII}^a$ & R$_{S0}^a$ & R$_{HeII}$/R$_{HII}^{b}$ & R$_{HeII}$/R$_{HII}^{c}$ \\
\hline
O3III & 44540 & 49.77 & 3.44 & 3.23 & 0.959 & 1.04\\
O8III & 33960 & 48.88 & 1.70 & 1.22 & 0.763 & 0.709\\
O4V & 42860 & 49.44 & 2.63 & 2.38 & 0.935 & 1.03\\
O3I & 42230 & 49.78 & 3.42 & 3.40 & 0.929 & 0.996\\
O8I & 33180 & 49.25 & 2.28 & 1.63 & 0.749 & 0.732 \\
\hline 
\caption{$^a$ Radii given in units of 10$^{18}$ cm.\\$^b$ Calculated using Cloudy\\$^c$ Calculated using Eq. 15.36 }
\end{tabular}

For all stars, the actual (Cloudy) ionization regions are slightly larger than the Str\"omgren
radii. The agreement is better for the hotter O stars, and worse for the cooler O stars. This is
because as qH increases, the ionization region becomes better approximated by a Str\"omgren Sphere.
The approximation as a Str\"omgren Sphere improves for larger qH because the mean free
path of an ionizing photon (Eq. 15.5) becomes smaller relative to R$_{S0}$ (mfp $<<$ R$_{S0}$), since
R$_{S0}$ increases with increasing qH. Since
a Str\"omgren Sphere assumes a discontinious boundary between ionized and neutral gas,
the boundary region becomes smaller (approached 0, i.e. is discontinious) as R$_{S0}$ increases. 

\subsection{b) Radii of He II vs H II zones:}
I define the HeII region as that where x$_{HeI}$$>$0.1, as was done for HII above.
To compare the results to Eq. 15.36, I assume y = 0.2 and z = 0.8 as done in the 
book in Sec. 15.5. The $\alpha_{B}$(H), $\alpha_{1s}$(He) $\alpha_{B}$(He) values 
are taken from Table 14.1, Eq. 14.14, and Eq. 14.15 respectively; all three are a
function of temperature. n$_H$ = 10$^{3}$ is taken from the model, and n$_{He}$ is 
obtained using the defined abundance of He relative to H given in the model. The
results are shown in the last two columns of Table ~\ref{table:stromgren}. The
differences between the Cloudy results and the analytic calculation are not
too bad, within 8.4\%, 7.0\%, 10.2\%, 7.2\%, and 2.3\% for each star respectively.
The errors are most likely due to the assumptions made on y and z.

\subsection{c) Temperature diagnostics:}
The volume integrated emissivities (i.e. the line strengths) for the 
5007\AA and 4363\AA lines of OIII are obtained from the model and are tabulated
for each star in Table ~\ref{table:partc}. Included also is the 
diagnostic radio of the 4363\AA to 5007\AA line, and the average electron
temperature in the nebula. Comparing this to Fig. 18.2, the results agree well
(assuming n$_{e}<$10$^{3}$). Each star has a ratio between
$\sim$2.0$\times$10$^{-3}$, which indicates an electron temperature of around
8$\times$10$^{3}$ K. This agrees with the actual averaged electron temperature.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
\label{table:partc}
Star & OIII 5007A / 10$^{37}$ $^{a}$ & OIII 4363A / 10$^{34}$ $^{a}$ & Ratio/10$^{-3}$
& $<$T$_{e}>$/10$^{3}$ K \\
\hline
O3III & 12.0 & 38.0 & 3.17 & 8.67 \\
O8III & 0.378 & 0.776 & 2.05 & 7.47 \\
O4V & 4.43 & 12.8 & 2.88 & 8.34 \\
O3I & 9.57 & 26.9 & 2.81 & 8.40 \\
O8I & 0.841 & 1.67 & 1.98 & 7.46\\
\hline 
%\caption{$^{a}$ Given are the volume integrated emissivities (line intensities)}
\end{tabular}


\subsection{d) Density Diagnostics:}
The electron density varies most dramatically towards larger radii. More specifically,
the density decreases dramatically through the boundary between the ionization and 
neutral regions, out to the edge of the system. The dramatic increase in the last couple
of percent
of the normalized radius indicates a fairly sharp transition region from ionized
to neutral.

The low density limit in Eq. 18.5 has a temperature dependence on the rate coefficients
($\Omega_{ul}$) as given in Table F.5. For the temperature in this equation, I use
the temperature at the region where the number density of electrons is a minimum
(NOTE: with the ratio, the temperature dependence is very weak, so this doesn't
really matter much). The high density limit is given by Eq. 18.6, with constants
g2 and g1 obtained from Fig. 18.3, and A$_{20}$=1.88$\times$10$^{-4}$s$^{-1}$
A$_{10}$=5.63$\times$10$^{-4}$s$^{-1}$ obtained from the NIST table.
Fig.~\ref{fig:density example} gives an example of the density diagnostic for an O3I
star with the lower and upper density limits plotted at a line ratio of 1.50 and 
0.50 respectively. The actual ratio of the nebula's emission is within these bounds
for all stars. The transition point occurs at an electron density of around 10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$
for each star (I just eyeballed this from the plots).

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./figures/DensityDiagnostic.eps}
\caption{Density diagnostic for an O3I star with plotted low and high density
limits on the ratio. The Cloudy ratio is between these bounds.}
\label{fig:density example}
\end{figure}


\subsection{e) BPT Diagram:}
The BPT diagram for all stars is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BPT}. As shown, the stars
occur on the BPT diagram in order of temperature/qH (hottest at the top, coolest
at the bottom). This implies that as qH increases, the corresponding nebula
shifts up and to the right on the BPT diagram. This means both the NII and 
OIII lines become stronger, relative to H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ respectively,
as qH increases. Tracking the 80\% region,
(NOTE: I'm using a different colormap, but 80\% is still orange in my case),
it appears on the horizontal portion (lower NII/H$\alpha$, higher OIII/H$\beta$)
for the hotter stars (O3III, O3I, and O4V in this case), and is more on the 
vertical portion (higher NII/H$\alpha$, lower OIII/H$\beta$) for the cooler
stars (O8III and O8I).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./figures/BPTDiagram_all_stars.eps}
\caption{BPT Diagram for all 5 O stars. The plus signs represent the O8I star,
and are hard to see, but are lined up roughly with the diamonds from the O8III
star}
\label{fig:BPT}
\end{figure}

One could use this trend to, in principle, pick out the relative ages of galaxies
and learn something about their star formation. Galaxies appearing towards the
right (more vertical) side of the figure will have cooler, older O stars, while
galaxies appearing up and towards the left (horizontal) will have hotter,
younger O stars. In the latter, then, star formation was more recent.


\subsection{f) Metallicity variations:}
Decreasing the metallicity has two immediately obvious effects on the electron temperature in
the nebula. The first, is that it raises the overall electron temperature for the entire nebula.
Eyeballing averages from the graphs, the average temperature (given as T$_{4}$) increases
from around 1.1 to 1.8 between the 0.3 and 0.01 metallicity values. The second effect is 
to smooth out the overall temperature, removing peaks at larger radii. In addition, there is 
a noticeable depression in the temperature in the ionized region for the 0.3 case, that
is gone in the 0.01 case (roughly linear).

A lower metallicity implies that 
more high energy ionizing photons (above Helium's ionization energy) are 
available (there are less metals to absorb them). This increases the chances 
that one of these higher energy photons will ionize Hydrogen, imparting a larger
kinetic energy on the ejected electron, raising the electron temperature. 

The ratio of the OIII 4346A line to the OIII 5007A line in the temperature diagnostic
increases with decreasing metallicity. Assuming roughly constant electron densities
between the three cases (for comparisons sake), which is fine if n$_{e}$ is below 1000 
cm$^{-3}$, an increase in the ratio implies a hotter medium, which is the case. The
average electron temperature increases with decreasing metallicity, from 1.0$\times$10$^{4}$ K
to 1.5$\times$10$^{4}$ K between the 0.3 to 0.01 cases.

The emissivities all decrease as metallicity decreases (H$\beta$ has the smallest change).
For the 0.01 metallicity case, the SII and NII emissivities become very small at all radii. OIII
is now below H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ at all radii (not the case for 0.3 metallicity).
H$\alpha$ is dominant at the lower metallicity. Though the total emissivity decreases for all lines,
the ratio of H$\alpha$ to H$\beta$ appears to be approximately the same across metallicity.
